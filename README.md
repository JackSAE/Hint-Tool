# Hint-Tool
The Hint Tool was designed and made for a game called [**InClover**](https://matthewdavies.itch.io/in-clover), it allows hints to be made in an instant.

## Features
* Create Hints in an instant using the Hint Tool Editor
* Hints Last 3 Seconds before disappearing
* Can Toggle to have hints always appear when walking into a trigger


## How To Use
* To Create a New Hint, Go To Windows -> Hint Creator
* A Editor Window will pop up, You can add in an image, Prefab*, Hint Name*, Hint Text* and a toggle if you want the hint to show everytime someone enters into the collider.
* **YOU NEED A PREFAB** for this tool to work. (There is a test hint in there that is just a box collider.)
* After entering all the data for the hint, hit "Finish and Save" 
* This will then create a Prefab with the hint object on it, to Find this prefab: Prefabs Folder -> Hints Folder.
* Then just simply drag the prefab into the scene
* Only a Player with the **"PLAYER" Tag** can trigger a hint
